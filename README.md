## About Me ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Java Developer with 2.5 years of experience specializing in building and maintaining healthcare applications. I have hands-on expertise in Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, RESTful APIs, and MySQL/Oracle databases. I thrive in agile environments, delivering stable, high-quality code and implementing complex business rules to meet client needs.

I am currently working on healthcare-based applications, including the New Hampshire MMIS Health Enterprise Portal, where I focus on enhancing functionality, fixing defects, and improving application stability. I also enjoy exploring advanced topics in Spring Boot and constantly improving my skills through projects and learning.
